Written in Python.

##1. What is SolarEyes?

SolarEyes looks for nodes marked with a custom attribute in SolarWinds & creates them in Thousand Eyes as a test. If
nodes are removed from SolarWinds, the related test is also removed from ThousandEyes to keep the two systems in sync.

SolarWinds is treated as the master, so any test deletions on ThousandEyes will be ignored and re-added during the
next synchronisation.

##2. Libraries

Libraries are not included in the repository, so be sure to install them with command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

* Requests - HTTP requests library.

##3. Installation

* Download the source.
* Download the library dependencies with pip (see above).
* Create a custom boolean attribute in SolarWinds and set the nodes that require synchronisation to 'True'.
* Configure the settings (username, password etc) for both the SolarWinds & ThousandEyes APIs.
* Configure the script to run on a schedule. Once per hour should be more than adequate.
